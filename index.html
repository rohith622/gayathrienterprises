        <h2><p>Seeds are the basic input for agriculture and crop production.</p>
        <p>They are the carriers of genetic information of plants.</p>
        <p>Good quality seeds ensure healthy crop growth and better yield.</p>
        <p>Seeds can be classified as hybrid seeds, open-pollinated seeds, and genetically modified seeds.</p>
        <p>Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-breeding two different parent plants.</p>
        <p>They provide higher yields and better resistance to diseases.</p>
        <p>Open-pollinated seeds are naturally pollinated and can be saved for replanting.</p>
        <p>Genetically modified seeds are engineered for specific traits like pest resistance.</p>
        <p>Certified seeds are tested for purity, germination, and quality.</p>
        <p>Seed treatment with fungicides or pesticides helps protect against diseases.</p>
        <p>Proper storage of seeds is important to maintain their viability.</p>
        <p>Seeds should be kept in a cool, dry, and pest-free environment.</p>
        <p>Farmers should select seeds suitable for their soil and climate conditions.</p>

        <h2><p>Fertilizers are substances added to soil to provide essential nutrients for plant growth.</p>
        <p>They help in increasing the yield and quality of crops.</p>
        <p>Fertilizers supply nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium which are vital for plants.</p>
        <p>They are mainly of two types: organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers.</p>
        <p>Organic fertilizers include compost, manure, and bio-fertilizers.</p>
        <p>Chemical fertilizers are produced using industrial processes.</p>
        <p>Some common chemical fertilizers are Urea, DAP, and Potash.</p>
        <p>Urea is the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer in India.</p>
        <p>Phosphorus-based fertilizers like DAP help in root development.</p>
        <p>Potash fertilizers are important for fruit and flower formation.</p>
        <p>Balanced fertilizer use ensures better productivity of soil.</p>
