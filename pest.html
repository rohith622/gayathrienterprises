            Pesticides play a crucial role in protecting crops from harmful insects, pests, and diseases that can damage plants and reduce yield.
             They are chemical or biological substances used to control unwanted organisms that affect agricultural productivity. 
             By using pesticides, farmers can prevent the spread of pests, protect plant health, and ensure better-quality produce. 
             The correct use of pesticides helps in maintaining food supply, reducing crop loss, and increasing profitability.
            However, it is essential to use them carefully and in the right quantities to avoid harmful effects on the environment, soil, and human health.
